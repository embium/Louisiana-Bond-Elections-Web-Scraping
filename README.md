# Louisiana Bond Elections Web Scraping

    A script to scrape Louisiana Bond Election results

    The goal of this task is to scrape bond election results data from the following url: https://voterportal.sos.la.gov/graphical

    The document 'Louisiana Scraping Instructions.docx' contains detailed instructions on how to collect and operate the website. The csv file 'bonds_la.csv' contains an example output.

    I didn't complete the project in a quick enough time and missed out on a job. Now I'm releasing the script for free. Enjoy!
